Here is the text from the previous conversation, separated into a new line after every full stop.\n","\n","***\n","\n","Arre Sameer, tu yahan, kaisa hai bhai?\n","Kitne time baad dikh raha hai, literally feels like ages, I swear.\n","Haan yaar Rohan, main bhi aapse yahi kehne wala tha, where have you been, man?\n","Life aisi ho gayi hai na, ki bas office se ghar aur ghar se office, weekend pe thodi saans aati hai toh lagta hai ki bas so jao.\n","Sach keh raha hai bhai, bilkul sach.\n","Main toh itna pak gaya hoon na apni job se, I can't even tell you.\n","Wahi roz ki presentation, wahi client calls, wahi boss ki bakwas.\n","My brain has turned to mush.\n","It's like a constant loop.\n","Remember woh Black Mirror ka episode?\n","Bas waisi hi feeling aati hai.\n","I know, right?\n","Apne field mein bhi same scene hai.\n","Code, debug, deploy, repeat.\n","Aur agar galti se koi bug production mein chala gaya, toh bas ho gaya kalyan.\n","Raat ke do baje call aayega, \"Sameer, system down hai, login nahi ho raha hai.\n","\" Arre bhai, main insaan hoon ya server monitor?\n","Unko lagta hai humaare paas koi magic wand hai, ghumaya aur sab theek.\n","Exactly!\n","Mere boss ko lagta hai ki marketing matlab 'make it viral'.\n","Usne kal mujhe bula ke bola, \"Rohan, yeh naye biscuit ka campaign hai, isko viral kar do.\n","\" Maine poocha, \"Sir, strategy kya hai?\n","Target audience?\n","Budget?\n","\" Kehta hai, \"Tum young generation ho, tumko sab pata hai.\n","Kuch cool sa bana do.\n","Koi meme use karlo.\n","\" Matlab, hadd hai yaar.\n","Meme use karlo?\n","Does he even know how memes work?\n","They are organic, bhai.\n","You can't just 'use a meme'.\n","Yeh C-suite waalon ko lagta hai social media matlab free ka playground hai.\n","Free ka nahi hai bhai, it demands creativity, effort, and a deep understanding of the culture.\n","But unko kaun samjhaye?\n","Unko toh bas numbers chahiye, reach, engagement, impressions.\n","Vanity metrics pe jeete hain sab.\n","Aur ab toh ek nayi team lead aa gayi hai, Kyra.\n","Oh God, she's something else.\n","London se padhke aayi hai and she thinks she knows everything.\n","Har cheez mein 'In my previous organisation, we used to do it like this'.\n","Arre behen, yeh India hai, woh London nahi tha, yahan jugaad se kaam chalta hai, SOP se nahi.\n","Hahaha, bhai yeh 'foreign-returned' wala complex toh har office mein mil jaayega.\n","Hamare yahan bhi ek banda aaya hai US se, Vinesh.\n","Woh har cheez ko dollar mein convert karke dekhta hai.\n","\"Oh, the coffee machine cost $500?\n","That's a good investment for employee morale.\n","\" Bhai, yahan 40,000 rupaye hote hain woh, usme hum do intern rakh lein.\n","Aur morale ki baat toh karo hi mat.\n","Appraisal ke time pe aisi kanjoosi dikhate hain jaise inki personal property se paisa ja raha ho.\n","\"The company is not doing well,\" yeh inka favourite dialogue hai.\n","Aur agle hi hafte new office ki renovation ka plan aa jaayega.\n","It's all a scam, man.\n","A corporate scam.\n","Remember college ke din?\n","Kitna chill tha sab.\n","Class bunk karke canteen mein samosa-chai, woh last moment pe assignment copy karna, proxy lagwana.\n","Those were the days.\n","Seriously, man.\n","Professor Sharma ki class mein peeche baith ke Tinkle padhna, that was my peak intellectual activity.\n","Aur woh fest ka time?\n","Oh my god, the chaos, the energy.\n","Raat raat bhar kaam karte the, but thakaan nahi hoti thi.\n","Ek passion tha, ek junoon tha.\n","Ab toh bas 9 baje login karne ka junoon hai.\n","Aur uss time pe aage ka socha hi nahi tha.\n","Lagta tha bas degree mil jaaye, ek acchi si job lag jaaye, life set hai.\n","Ghanta set hai.\n","Yahan toh roz reset ho rahi hai.\n","Aur aage ka kya plan?\n","Shaadi-vaadi ka kuch socha?\n","Arre yaar, kahan phasa raha hai tu.\n","Pehle ek dhang ki life toh ho.\n","Priya se break-up hue 6 mahine ho gaye, abhi tak uss zone se hi bahar nahi aa paya hoon theek se.\n","It was getting too toxic, you know.\n","Constant fights, expectations.\n",".\n",".\n","I just couldn't handle it anymore.\n","Oh shit, I didn't know that.\n","I'm sorry to hear that, bro.\n","It's alright.\n","Sometimes things are just not meant to be.\n","But ab akele bhi ajeeb lagta hai.\n","Friends sab apni life mein busy hain, shaadi kar rahe hain, bacche ho rahe hain.\n","We are all growing up, but I feel like I'm stuck.\n","It’s not about being alone, it’s about being lonely.\n","I get it, man.\n","I totally get it.\n","Mere saath bhi same scene hai.\n","Rashmi se baat chalti hai but it's complicated.\n","Long distance hai na, toh wahi trust issues, communication gap.\n","Video call pe aadhi baat toh 'awaaz nahi aa rahi' mein nikal jaati hai.\n","It's tough.\n","But kya karein, this is life.\n","Humein lagta tha hum bade hokar duniya badal denge, yahan life ne humein hi badal diya.\n","Sahi bola.\n","Chal chhod yeh sab depressing baatein.\n","Kuch accha bata.\n","Woh Goa ka plan bana rahe the sab, uska kya hua?\n","Wahi, 'sab' ka plan kabhi banta nahi hai.\n","Aakash ko chutti nahi mil rahi, Preeti is pregnant, aur Sumit toh US shift ho gaya.\n","Hum do-teen log hi bache hain.\n","Ek kaam karte hain, next long weekend pe hum dono hi kahin nikal chalte hain.\n","What say?\n","Mountains?\n","Rishikesh chalte hain, thoda peace milega.\n","Done!\n","Bhai, this is the best idea I've heard in months.\n","Seriously, let's just do it.\n","No more planning on WhatsApp groups that die a slow death.\n","Bas tu aur main.\n","Ticket book karte hain.\n","And no work calls, no emails.\n","Phone switch off karke bas Ganga kinaare baithenge.\n","Perfect.\n","Aur wahan baith ke sochenge ki life mein aage karna kya hai.\n","Yeh corporate slavery se azaadi kaise paani hai.\n","Sahi mein, I've been thinking about starting something of my own.\n","Ek chhota sa cafe, maybe.\n","Books, coffee, good music.\n","A place where people can just come and be themselves.\n","That sounds amazing, Rohan.\n","You've always had that creative spark.\n","You should definitely think about it seriously.\n","It's a risk, for sure, but isn't life a risk?\n","Roz 8 ghante aisi job mein invest karna jisse tum nafrat karte ho, woh zyada bada risk nahi hai?\n","Deep.\n","That’s really deep, man.\n","But true.\n","Hum log security ke chakkar mein apne dreams ko side mein rakh dete hain.\n","Aur phir ek din realise hota hai ki aadha time nikal gaya aur humne kiya kya?\n","Bas EMI bhari aur taxes diye.\n","Aur weekend pe Netflix dekha.\n","Speaking of which, koi nayi series dekhi?\n","Haan, woh 'Kalapani' dekhi, an Indian series.\n","It's brilliant, man.\n","The concept, the acting, sab kuch top-notch.\n","Tu bhi dekhna.\n","Cool, I'll check it out.\n","Main toh abhi bhi 'Panchayat' ke loop mein phasa hua hoon.\n","Jitni baar dekho, utna accha lagta hai.\n","It's so simple and so real.\n","Shows the real India, you know.\n","Not the fancy Dharma productions wala India.\n","True.\n","Wohi 'dekh raha hai na Binod' wala feel.\n","By the way, woh Binod ka kya hua?\n","Aaya aur chala gaya.\n","That's the nature of the internet, isn't it?\n","One day you are a hero, the next day you are a forgotten meme.\n","Just like our motivation on a Monday morning.\n","It exists for a fleeting moment and then vanishes.\n","Hahaha, so true.\n","Arre, order toh kar lein kuch.\n","Bas baaton mein hi pet bhar loge kya?\n","Chal, ek cutting chai aur bun maska bol.\n","The classic combo.\n","College waali feeling aa jayegi.\n","Haan, aur uske baad ek aur round chai ka, with a sutta break.\n","Just like old times.\n","Woh canteen ke bahar baith ke\n","duniya jahan ki politics discuss karna, films pe behas karna, aur future ke bade bade plan banana.\n","Hum log kitne naive the, na?\n","Lagta tha sab kuch kitna aasan hai.\n","We had answers for everything.\n","Aur ab?\n","Ab har cheez pe question mark hai.\n","Am I in the right career?\n","Is this the right city?\n","Am I with the right people?\n","It's a constant state of confusion.\n","Maybe that's what growing up is.\n","Realizing that you don't have all the answers, and being okay with it.\n","Maybe.\n","But sometimes, it's just exhausting.\n","I miss the certainty of youth.\n","The black and white world.\n","Ab toh sab grey hai.\n","Life in shades of grey.\n","That could be a title for our biopic.\n","Hahaha, 'Corporate Zombies: A Tale of Two Friends'.\n","Box office pe pit jaayegi.\n","Who wants to see a movie about their own sad life?\n","Log toh escape ke liye theatre jaate hain.\n","True that.\n","They want to see a hero fighting a hundred guys, not a guy fighting with his excel sheet.\n","Arre excel sheet se yaad aaya, mujhe woh quarterly report bhejni hai raat 12 baje se pehle.\n","My boss just pinged me, \"ETA?\n","\".\n","Dekha?\n","I told you.\n","We can't escape.\n","Yeh digital leash hai jo humare gale mein bandhi hui hai.\n","But you know what?\n","Aaj main thoda rebel mode mein hoon.\n","I'll send it tomorrow morning.\n","Let's enjoy this moment.\n","Hum itne time baad mile hain.\n","Work can wait.\n","That's the spirit, my friend.\n","Screw the ETA.\n","Let's have another chai.\n","And this time, let's talk about happy things.\n","Koi funny kissa suna college ka.\n","Remember that time we tried to cook Maggi in a kettle in the hostel room and short-circuited the entire floor's electricity?\n","Oh my god, yes!\n","Aur warden ne humein pakad liya tha.\n","He was so angry.\n","\"Tum log engineer banoge ya hotel management waale?\n","\" he shouted.\n","Aur humne kitni masoomiyat se bola tha, \"Sir, innovation kar rahe the.\n","\" Innovation ke naam pe poore hostel ko andhere mein daal diya tha.\n","Aur phir agle din sabke room se extension cord zabt ho gaye the.\n","What a disaster!\n","But it was fun.\n","Abhi aisi cheezein karne ka socha bhi nahi jaa sakta.\n","We have become too 'civilized', too 'responsible'.\n","Responsibility is a trap.\n","The more you get, the less you live.\n","Look at us.\n","We have our own money, our own places, but we are not as happy as we were in that cramped hostel room with a shared bathroom.\n","Kyunki tab freedom thi, in the real sense.\n","Ab toh bas illusion of freedom hai.\n","We can buy anything we want, but we don't have the time to enjoy it.\n","I bought a PS5 last year.\n","Pata hai kitni baar khela hoon?\n","Maybe five times.\n","It's just gathering dust.\n","Same here.\n","Maine ek guitar khareeda tha, socha tha seekhunga.\n","It's leaning against a wall, judging me every day for my life choices.\n","Hum sab cheezein khareedte hain uss 'ideal self' ke liye jo hum banna chahte hain, not for the person we actually are.\n","The person we are is too tired to learn guitar after a 10-hour workday.\n","He just wants to crash.\n","So what's the solution, man?\n","Aise hi chalta rahega?\n","I don't know.\n","Maybe the solution is to stop searching for a solution.\n","Maybe we just need to take it one day at a time.\n","Find small joys.\n","Like this conversation.\n","This cup of tea.\n","For me, right now, this is happiness.\n","You've become quite the philosopher, Rohan.\n","But I agree.\n","Yeh achanak se milna, purani baatein yaad karna, it feels good.\n","It feels real.\n","Iske liye koi KPI nahi hai, koi target achieve nahi karna.\n","It’s just… authentic.\n","Authentic.\n","That's the word.\n","Our lives have become so curated, so artificial.\n","Instagram pe sab happy vacations pe jaa rahe hain, LinkedIn pe sabko promotion mil raha hai.\n","It's a pressure cooker.\n","And we are all just trying to look perfect.\n","But andar se sab khokhle hain.\n","It's a highlight reel, not the behind-the-scenes footage.\n","Nobody posts about their failures, their rejections, their lonely nights.\n","Sabko bas 'living the dream' dikhana hai.\n","Aur hum log woh dekh ke aur depressed hote hain ki humari life mein hi kuch aacha nahi ho raha.\n","It’s a vicious cycle.\n","I’ve started detoxing from social media on weekends.\n","It helps.\n","A little bit.\n","I should try that too.\n","Mera screen time is scary.\n","Sometimes I just scroll endlessly without even registering what I'm seeing.\n","It’s a mindless habit.\n","A way to numb the brain.\n","Chalo, enough gyaan for one day.\n","Ab practical baatein karte hain.\n","Rishikesh trip.\n","Kab ka plan banayein?\n","Next month second Saturday ko holiday hai.\n","We can take a leave on Friday.\n","Three-day trip.\n","Sounds perfect.\n","Main abhi se leave apply kar deta hoon isse pehle ki koi aur le le.\n","And I'll look for some good riverside camps.\n","AC waala mat karna, thoda rustic feel aana chahiye.\n","Obviously, bro.\n","We are going for peace, not for luxury.\n","Tents mein rahenge.\n","Bonfire hoga.\n","Stargazing karenge.\n","Maybe try some river rafting if we feel adventurous.\n","I'm already excited.\n","This is much needed.\n","It feels like I can finally breathe.\n","Me too.\n","Ab lag raha hai ki aage ke kuch hafte nikal jaayenge iss trip ke excitement mein.\n","It gives you something to look forward to, right?\n","Warna toh wahi endless tunnel wali feeling aati hai.\n","Absolutely.\n","Ek hope mil jaati hai.\n","Arre, woh dekh, Sharma Sir ja rahe hain.\n","Apne college waale.\n","Oh haan!\n","Wahi hai.\n","Same walk, same jhola.\n","Kuch log kabhi nahi badalte.\n","Chal, awaaz de?\n","Nahi yaar, rehne de.\n","Ab kya bolenge unse?\n","\"Sir, yaad hai aapne humein fail karne ki dhamki di thi?\n","Dekho hum abhi bhi fail hi ho rahe hain, bas subject alag hai.\n","\" Hahaha.\n","Subject hai 'Life'.\n","Aur isme koi syllabus nahi hai, koi marking scheme nahi hai.\n","Bas pass hote jaana hai, somehow.\n","Or maybe there's no pass or fail.\n","There's just.\n",".\n",".\n","living.\n","Wow.\n","Second philosophical gem of the day.\n","Tu pakka cafe kholega, I can see it.\n","Cafe ka naam rakhenge 'The Grey Area'.\n","Sounds cool, no?\n","It does.\n","And I'll be your first and most loyal customer.\n","I'll come every day after my soul-sucking job to find some solace.\n","And free coffee, I hope?\n","Obviously.\n","For you, everything is on the house.\n","Bas wahan aake corporate jargon mat use karna.\n","No 'synergy', 'low-hanging fruit', or 'let's circle back on this'.\n","Deal.\n","Wahan pe sirf 'chai', 'baatein', aur 'sukoon' allowed hoga.\n","It's a deal.\n","Chal ab, nikalte hain.\n","Kaafi time ho gaya.\n","Woh report bhi toh hai, even if I send it late, karna toh padega hi.\n","The rebel in you died quickly.\n","He didn't die, he just went for a short coffee break.\n","He'll be back.\n","He has to be.\n","Chal, bill main karta hoon.\n","Arre nahi, let's split.\n","No arguments.\n","Theek hai, jaisi teri marzi.\n","But next time, my treat.\n","For sure.\n","At 'The Grey Area'.\n","Hopefully.\n","Let's not say hopefully.\n","Let's say 'soon'.\n","We need to start believing in our own plans, man.\n","Okay.\n","Soon.\n","It was great seeing you, Sameer.\n","Same here, Rohan.\n","Bohot accha laga milke.\n","Call me when you get home.\n","You too.\n","And send me the details for the trip.\n","Don't let this plan die.\n","I won't.\n","This one is for our sanity.\n","Chalo, bye.\n","Bye bhai, take care.\n","You too.\n","Phir milte hain.\n","Zaroor.\n","Jaldi.\n","Bas iss sheher ki traffic se nikal ke ghar pahunch jaun pehle, wahi ek achievement hoga.\n","Haha, uske liye toh all the best.\n","It's a battle out there.\n","A daily battle.\n","But aaj aapse milkar, lag raha hai ki I've won a small victory.\n","The feeling is mutual, my friend.\n","The feeling is mutual.\n","Ab nikal, warna boss sach mein call kar dega.\n","Haan haan, jaa raha hoon.\n","But seriously, that Kyra story, I want more details next time.\n","Oh, you'll get them.\n","Uske kaarnaamein itne hain ki ek poori web series ban jaaye.\n","'Kyra from London'.\n","Perfect title.\n","Chal, bye.\n","Okay, bye.\n","Bas yeh final hai.\n","Ab sach mein jaa raha hoon.\n","Okay.\n","Good night.\n","Good night.\n","Yeh sheher bhi na, itna bada hai, par phir bhi kabhi kabhi bohot chhota lagta hai jab koi purana dost achanak se takra jaata hai.\n","Aur kabhi kabhi itna akela, ki lagta hai yahan apna koi hai hi nahi.\n","It's a paradox.\n","We live in a paradox.\n","Chalo, ispe agli baar chai pe चर्चा karenge.\n","Done.\n","But seriously, that cafe idea is solid.\n","I’m not kidding.\n","Think about it.\n","I will.\n","I promise.\n","Aaj raat report bhej ke, excel band karke, ek business plan ka template kholunga.\n","Just to see.\n","That’s the first step.\n","That’s all it takes.\n","Ek chhota sa step.\n","And who knows where it might lead.\n","Exactly.\n","The possibilities are endless.\n","Chal, ab sach mein final wala bye.\n","Final wala bye.\n","Take it easy.\n","Tu bhi.\n","Aur haan, 'Kalapani' dekhna, seriously.\n","Theek hai bhai, dekh lunga.\n","Aur tu 'Panchayat' ka naya season.\n","Deal.\n","Chalo.\n","Okay.\n","Bye.\n","Okay.\n","Bye.\n","Haan, ghar pahunch ke text karta hoon.\n","Tu bhi kar dena.\n","For sure.\n","Chal.\n","Ek minute.\n","Kya hua?\n","Yaar, ek baat bata.\n","Pooch.\n","Do you ever play the 'what if' game?\n","What if game? Matlab?\n","Matlab, what if we had made different choices?\n","What if I had taken Science instead of Commerce in 11th grade?\n","What if I had actually prepared for JEE like my dad wanted?\n","Oh god, that game.\n","Sometimes.\n","Usually raat ko 3 baje, jab neend nahi aati aur existential crisis kick in karta hai.\n","Aaj kal roz hi kick in kar raha hai.\n","I mean, seriously think about it.\n","Agar hum IIT mein hote, life kitni different hoti, na?\n","Different hoti, for sure.\n","Better hoti, I'm not so sure.\n","Kyun?\n","Better package, better opportunities, US jaane ka chance.\n","Sab set hota.\n","Shayad.\n","Ya phir hum wahan bhi system ko gaali de rahe hote.\n","Wahan pe professor ko 'Gabbar' bula rahe hote.\n","Wahan pe bhi corporate slavery hoti, bas thodi zyada high-paying hoti.\n","Grass is always greener on the other side, Rohan.\n","I guess.\n","But the choices we make, they define everything.\n","Remember Aakash?\n","Haan, aapan saala.\n","He chose to go to Canada for his Masters.\n","And now he's settled there.\n","Uski Instagram stories dekhta hoon, hiking, skiing, road trips.\n","Aisa lagta hai woh alag hi dimension mein jee raha hai.\n","Haan, aur uski story ke neeche chhota sa text bhi hota hai, \"Missing home.\n","\" \"Missing mom ke haath ka khaana.\n","\" Bhai, sabke apne struggles hain.\n","Hum yahan EMI ka stress le rahe hain, woh wahan loneliness aur identity crisis se deal kar raha hoga.\n","True.\n","Har jagah kuch na kuch toh hai hi.\n","There's no perfect life.\n","There are just different sets of problems.\n","You just have to choose which set of problems you are willing to live with.\n","Yeh kisne bola?\n","Mark Manson.\n","The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck.\n","Padhi hai?\n","Nahi, bas summary dekhi thi YouTube pe.\n","Padhna.\n","It's a good book.\n","Kaafi practical gyaan hai.\n","Hmm.\n","Daal leta hoon wishlist mein.\n","Waise, since we are playing the 'what if' game.\n",".\n",".\n","What if you had told Priya's parents that you loved her and wanted to marry her, right at the beginning?\n","Wow.\n","Straight for the jugular, huh?\n","Sorry, too personal ho gaya kya?\n","Nahi nahi, it's okay.\n","Hum dost hain, itna toh chalta hai.\n","I have thought about that.\n","Many times.\n","Shayad cheezein different hoti.\n","Shayad woh log maan jaate.\n","Shayad woh fight hi nahi karte itna.\n","But main darr gaya tha, Sameer.\n","I was scared.\n","Mera career tabhi start hua tha.\n","I wasn't earning much.\n","And her family was well-settled, a typical 'bade log'.\n","Unke saamne jaake main kya bolta?\n","\"Uncle, main aapki beti se pyaar karta hoon, salary abhi kam hai, but future bright hai.\n","\" It sounds like a scene from a 90s movie.\n","Real life mein aisi cheezein work nahi karti.\n","They would have laughed me out of their house.\n","Ya phir maybe they would have respected your honesty.\n","You never know.\n","That's the thing, right?\n","We never know.\n","So we play it safe.\n","We wait for the 'right time'.\n","Aur woh 'right time' kabhi aata hi nahi.\n","Time nikal jaata hai, aur cheezein haath se chali jaati hain.\n","It wasn't just about the money, though.\n","It was about the pressure.\n","Her parents were constantly comparing me to other guys.\n","\"Dekho, uska boyfriend investment banker hai.\n","\" \"Uska fiancé doctor hai.\n","\" Main kya tha?\n","Ek ad agency mein copywriter.\n","Unke liye woh koi job hi nahi thi.\n","\"Yeh kya kaam hota hai?\n","Ads likhna?\n","Isme kya future hai?\"\n","People don't understand the creative field, man.\n","Unko lagta hai yeh sab hobby hai, timepass hai.\n","Real job matlab doctor, engineer, lawyer.\n","Exactly.\n","Aur Priya, she tried to defend me initially.\n","But dheere dheere, woh baatein uske dimaag mein bhi ghar karne lagi.\n","She started pushing me to look for a 'stable' job.\n","\"Why don't you try for an MBA?\n","\" \"Why don't you apply for a government job?\n","\" And that's when things started to go downhill.\n","She fell in love with a creative guy, but she wanted to marry a 'safe' guy.\n","And I couldn't be both.\n","That's tough, man.\n","It's sad how societal pressure can ruin a perfectly good relationship.\n","It does.\n","It slowly poisons everything.\n","The love is still there, but it gets buried under layers of expectations, compromises, and resentment.\n","Aur phir ek din, you just explode.\n","And it's all over.\n","Khaali haath reh jaate ho.\n","I get it.\n","Rashmi ke saath mera bhi similar scene hai, just the context is different.\n","Long distance.\n","Her parents are okay with me, but they want her to come back to India after her course is done.\n","And she wants to work there for a few years.\n","Toh abhi se hi ghar mein daily tension chalta hai.\n","Aur uska gussa, uski frustration, woh sab mere upar nikalti hai.\n","Video call pe aadhi baar toh hum isi baat pe ladte rehte hain.\n","It’s like we are fighting a battle that is not even ours.\n","It's her vs.\n","her parents, but I'm stuck in the crossfire.\n","Exactly!\n","Aur is sab ke beech, the actual relationship gets lost.\n","Woh pyaar, woh fun, woh companionship.\n",".\n",".\n","sab side mein chala jaata hai.\n","You become problem-solving partners instead of romantic partners.\n","Har call ek agenda ke saath hota hai.\n","\"Aaj is baare mein discuss karna hai.\n","\" It's exhausting.\n","So what's the plan?\n","I don't know.\n","Abhi toh chal raha hai.\n","Let's see.\n","She's supposed to come to India in December for a vacation.\n","Maybe tab face-to-face baithenge toh koi solution niklega.\n","I hope so, bro.\n","For your sake.\n","Thanks, man.\n","Chal, chhod yeh sab.\n","Aur koi 'what if' hai tere paas?\n","Let's go to a happier one.\n","What if we hadn't gotten caught for that Maggi-in-a-kettle incident?\n","Hahaha!\n","Toh hum hostel ke official MasterChefs ban jaate.\n","Log humare paas aate special requests leke.\n","\"Bhai, aaj kettle mein egg bhurji bana do.\n","\" \"Bhai, kettle wali chai mein woh baat nahi, aaj coffee ho jaaye.\n","\" We could have started a business.\n","'Kettle Kraft Inc.\n","' Our tagline would be: \"Innovation in every boil.\n","\" Aur warden humara first investor hota.\n","Nahi, woh humse hafta vasooli karta.\n","\"Floor ka aधा profit mera.\n","\" True that.\n","But seriously, those were the days of pure, unadulterated stupidity.\n","We had so much time and so little to worry about.\n","Our biggest worry was submitting the assignment on time.\n","Ya phir 75% attendance maintain karna.\n","Main toh abhi tak hairan hoon ki main graduate kaise ho gaya.\n","I think I saw the inside of a library for the first time in my final year.\n","Woh bhi, books issue karwane nahi, Preeti se milne ke liye.\n","Preeti.\n",".\n",".\n","wow, that's a name I haven't heard in a while.\n","Kya karti hai woh aaj kal?\n","She's a journalist.\n","For some big news channel.\n","Sometimes I see her on TV, reporting from some random protest or political rally.\n","She looks so serious and intense.\n","Yakeen nahi hota this is the same girl jo har baat pe 'hee hee' karke hasti thi.\n","People change.\n","We all have.\n","Look at us.\n","The Rohan I knew in college wanted to be a filmmaker.\n","He used to carry a handycam everywhere, shooting random stuff.\n","He made that ridiculous short film for our fest, 'The Vengeance of the Samosa'.\n","Arre yaar, woh yaad mat dila.\n","It was so cringe.\n","It was brilliant!\n","The samosa was the hero, and the chutney was the villain.\n","Pure genius.\n","I still have it on a hard drive somewhere.\n","Delete it.\n","Please delete it and burn the hard drive.\n","Never.\n","That's a masterpiece.\n","But seriously, what happened to that filmmaker Rohan?\n","He got lost.\n","Somewhere between client briefs and PowerPoint presentations.\n","You know, I tried.\n","After college, I worked as an assistant director for a few small ad films.\n","The pay was horrible, the working hours were insane.\n","20-hour shifts were normal.\n","You are treated like dirt.\n","Spot boy se leke director tak, sab gaali dete hain.\n","It's a thankless job.\n","I did it for six months, and my health took a massive hit.\n","I was barely sleeping, living on chai and cigarettes.\n","Ek din, I just collapsed on the set.\n","That's when I realized that maybe this is not for me.\n","The passion was there, but my body and mind gave up.\n","So I took a break, did a small course in digital marketing, and got this agency job.\n","The pay was good, the hours were fixed.\n","It was.\n",".\n",".\n","safe.\n","And comfortable.\n","The golden cage.\n","Yes.\n","The golden cage.\n","Dheere dheere, the comfort becomes an addiction.\n","You get used to the monthly salary, the weekend offs.\n","And the dream?\n","Woh bas ek purani hard drive mein padi short film banke reh jaata hai.\n","But it's never too late, you know.\n","Maybe you can start again.\n","As a hobby.\n","Write a script on weekends.\n","Shoot something on your phone.\n","Phones have amazing cameras now.\n","I know.\n","I think about it.\n","But phir wahi, energy nahi bachti.\n","The corporate world sucks the soul out of you, Sameer.\n","By the time the weekend comes, you are just a hollow shell.\n","You just want to recharge your batteries

Atyachaar'.\n","How can I forget?\n","You guys were awesome.\n","You played at every single college event.\n","I still remember your cover of 'Summer of '69'.\n","It was better than the original.\n","Arre, zyada ho gaya.\n","But yeah, that was my passion.\n","My guitar was like an extension of my body.\n","I used to practice for hours.\n","Socha tha, job ke saath saath music continue

Dreams'.\n","Hahaha.\n","Yeah.\n","But you know what's even sadder?\n","We are not alone.\n","Our entire generation is going through this.\n","We are all well-educated, well-paid, and deeply unhappy.\n","We are the burnout generation.\n","We have access to everything, but we feel nothing.\n","We scroll through hundreds of happy pictures, but we don't feel happy.\n","We watch motivational videos, but we feel no motivation.\n","It's a strange paradox.\n","Maybe we are just overthinking things.\n","Our parents' generation, they didn't have time for all this existential dread.\n","Unke liye life simple thi.\n","Padhai karo, naukri lo, shaadi karo, bacche paida karo, retire ho jao.\n","The end.\n","Kyunki unke paas options kam the.\n","And more options lead to more

can take a leave.\n","But if you are feeling anxious or depressed, you are supposed to just suck it up and work.\n","\"It's all in your head,\" they say.\n","Arre, of course it's in my

chewing paan masala and spitting it out of the window while driving on a ghat.\n","And he was playing only one song on loop.\n","'Hawa Hawa'.\n","For the entire five-hour journey.\n","By the end of it, main uss gaane se mentally scarred ho gaya tha.\n","Aur Preeti ko toh motion sickness ho gaya tha.\n","Poor girl.\n","She was throwing up throughout the journey.\n","Aur hum log, instead of helping her, we were making fun of her.\n","We were such idiots.\n","And then the main ghat section started, and the car's brakes failed.\n","Oh my God.\n","That was the scariest moment of my life.\n","The driver was so calm.\n","He was like, \"Tension nahi lene ka, saab.\n","Handbrake hai na.\n","\" Aur woh handbrake bhi aadhi hi kaam kar rahi thi.\n","I literally saw my whole life flash before my eyes.\n","Mera 'Vengeance of the Samosa' ka sequel ka dream, sab khatam.\n","And finally, jab gaadi ek jagah ruki, we all got out and kissed the ground.\n","Like they show in movies after a plane crash.\n","Aur uske baad, we had to trek for 3 kilometers with all our luggage to reach the hotel.\n","Which, by the way, was not the hotel we had booked.\n","Sumit had booked some shady 'Hotel Moonlight' which looked more like a haunted haveli.\n","There were spiders in the bathroom and the bedsheets had paan ke daag.\n","It was horrible.\n","And the manager was a creepy old man with one eye.\n","He kept staring at Preeti.\n","We decided we are not staying here.\n","So raat ke 11 baje, in a strange hill station, we were literally homeless.\n","With all our bags, roaming on the streets.\n","And our phones were dead because we forgot to carry a power bank.\n","Of course.\n","Because we were masters of planning.\n","And then we found that other hotel, 'Valley View'.\n","Which was way out of our budget.\n","Hum sab ne apne saare paise pool kiye just to afford one room for one night.\n","Ek room mein paanch log.\n","Two on the bed, three on the floor.\n","It was like a

were making jokes about our own misery.\n","We were singing songs.\n","We were happy.\n","Because we were together.\n","That's true.\n","That was the best part.\n","That feeling.\n",".\n",".\n","that

high.\n","My Vitamin D is dangerously low.\n","The doctor gave me a list of things I can't eat.\n","Basically, everything that tastes good is on that list.\n","Welcome to your 30s.\n","Where you have enough money to eat whatever you want, but your body won't let you.\n","It's a cruel joke.\n","And my parents, they are getting older too.\n","That's another stress.\n","Dad's knee problem, mom's

it.\n","The point is this conversation.\n","The point is this ice cream.\n","The point is the Rishikesh plan.\n","We have to create our own points.\n","Our own small pockets of happiness.\n","Like your cafe.\n","That's a very big point.\n","Haan.\n","The more I think about it, the more I feel that it's the right thing to do.\n","I don't want to be 50 and look back at my life with regret.\n","Ki maine try hi nahi kiya.\n","I'd rather try and fail than not try at all.\n","That's a great way to look at it.\n","Where would you open it?\n","Here in the city?\n","Or somewhere else?\n","I'm thinking of moving to a smaller town.\n","Maybe somewhere in the hills.\n","Like Dehradun, or maybe even further up.\n","The city is draining me.\n","The noise, the pollution, the constant rush.\n","I need a slower pace of life.\n","A place where I can actually breathe.\n","Where people are not just running after money.\n","That's a big decision, Rohan.\n","Leaving all this behind.\n","Your job, your friends, your life here.\n","I know.\n","But what am I leaving behind, really?\n","A job I hate?\n","A life that feels empty?\n","Friends toh waise bhi weekend pe hi milte hain, if we are lucky.\n","And with technology, you are always connected.\n","You can come visit my cafe.\n","I'll give you a lifetime discount.\n","That I will.\n","But a small town has its own challenges.\n","The mindset is different.\n","People are more conservative.\n","\"Log kya kahenge\" is a much bigger deal there.\n","I know.\n","But I won't be dealing with 'log'.\n","I'll be dealing with my customers.\n","Travellers, readers, artists.\n","People who are looking for a quiet corner to relax.\n","I want to build a community, not just a cafe.\n","A place for like-minded people.\n","It sounds like a dream.\n","It is.\n","And I want to make it a reality.\n","I'm saving up like a madman.\n","Har faltu kharcha band kar diya hai.\n","No more online shopping sprees, no more expensive gadgets.\n","Every penny goes into the 'Cafe Fund'.\n","I'm impressed, man.\n","You are actually doing it.\n","I'm trying.\n","It's the only thing that keeps me going through the week.\n","My little secret project.\n","It gives me hope.\n","That there is a light at the end of this corporate tunnel.\n","That's amazing.\n","Seriously.\n","What about you?\n","What's your escape plan?\n","Mera?\n","I don't have one.\n","I'm too pragmatic for grand escape plans.\n","Mera plan B is usually just a better version of plan A.\n","Like, switching to a product-based company for better work-life balance.\n","Or maybe trying for an on-site opportunity.\n","That's it?\n","That's your dream?\n","To switch from one cage to a slightly bigger, more comfortable cage?\n","When you put it like that, it sounds sad.\n","It is sad.\n","We are not meant to live in cages, Sameer.\n","We are meant to fly.\n","Cheesy, I know, but it's true.\n","I guess I'm just scared of flying.\n","What if I fall?\n","What if you fly?\n","You'll never know unless you try.\n","Look, I'm not saying quit your job tomorrow.\n","But at least have a dream.\n","A passion project.\n","Something that is just for you.\n","Not for your boss, not for your parents, not for society.\n","Your music.\n","Why don't you start again?\n","Just for fun.\n","Create a YouTube channel.\n","Put up your old covers.\n","Make new ones.\n","Who knows what might happen?\n","It's been so long.\n","My fingers are probably rusted.\n","Skill is like cycling, you never forget.\n","Thodi practice lagegi, that's it.\n","Think about it.\n","'Acoustic Atyachaar 2.\n","0'.\n","I'll think about it.\n","Promise?\n","Promise.\n","Good.\n","Because I don't want to be the only one escaping this rat race.\n","I need my partner in crime with me.\n","Even if we are in different cities.\n","Deal.\n","Chalo, ab sach mein nikalna chahiye.\n","Raat ke 1 baj gaye.\n","Oh shit.\n","Pata hi nahi chala.\n","Time flies when you are having a depressing-yet-strangely-therapeutic conversation.\n","True that.\n","Kal subah 9 baje wahi login karna hai.\n","The thought itself is painful.\n","Chhod.\n","Abhi uske baare mein nahi sochte.\n","Let's just enjoy this walk back.\n","The empty streets.\n","The cool breeze.\n","This moment.\n","Haan.\n","This moment is nice.\n","I feel lighter.\n","Like I've vented out a year's worth of frustration.\n","Me too.\n","We really should do this more often.\n","For sure.\n","The monthly ritual is on.\n","Next month, my treat.\n","At a new place.\n","Done.\n","Aur usse pehle, Rishikesh.\n","Yes.\n","Rishikesh.\n","Main kal pakka travel agent ko call karta hoon.\n","Let's get a quote for a riverside camping package.\n","Perfect.\n","No hotels.\n","Just tents and bonfire.\n","And your terrible singing.\n","Hey!\n","I'm a decent singer.\n","You are a decent bathroom singer.\n","Bonfire ke saamne woh talent chalta nahi hai.\n","We'll see.\n","I'll bring my guitar.\n","Now you're talking!\n","That's the spirit.\n","'Acoustic Atyachaar' live at the Ganga ghats.\n","That sounds like a plan.\n","A damn good plan.\n","\n","A deep, comfortable silence settled between them as they walked, a silence that wasn't awkward but was filled with the weight of their shared confessions and newfound resolutions.\n","The city around them had finally surrendered to the late hour, with the roaring traffic of the day now just a distant, forgotten hum, replaced by the occasional whir of a lone cab and the gentle rustling of leaves in the cool night breeze.\n","It felt like they were the only two people awake in the entire world, walking through a city that had shed its aggressive, chaotic skin to reveal a calmer, more vulnerable soul, a version of itself that you could only witness in these stolen, quiet moments after midnight.\n","\"You know,\" Sameer began, his voice softer than before, \"I was asking you all those practical questions about your cafe, not to discourage you, but because I want to see you actually succeed, and I know that a dream without a plan is just a wish.\"\n","He kicked a stray pebble on the pavement, watching it skitter into the darkness.\n","\"It’s easy for us to sit here and romanticize the idea of a quiet life in the hills, but the reality involves dealing with broken plumbing, unreliable electricity, and a whole lot of government paperwork that makes no sense.\"\n","Rohan nodded, appreciating the pragmatism that always grounded his own flights of fancy.\n","\"I know, man, and I've been thinking about all of that, spending countless nights on YouTube watching 'how-to' videos and reading blogs by people who've actually done it.\n","I know it's going to be a bureaucratic nightmare to get all the licenses, and the supply chain for good quality coffee beans will be a challenge, but I genuinely believe that the problems you solve for your own dream feel different from the problems you solve for a paycheque.\"\n","He gestured with his hands as he spoke, the passion reigniting in his eyes.\n","\"I want to hire local staff and train them, create a menu that uses local, seasonal produce along with the usual cafe stuff, and build a space that feels like an extension of the natural beauty around it, not some concrete box dropped in the middle of a forest.\"\n","\"That sounds incredible, a vision that’s about more than just business, which is exactly why I think it will work,\" Sameer affirmed, a genuine smile spreading across his face.\n","\"And you have to promise me you'll have a corner with a guitar, a permanent spot for 'Acoustic Atyachaar' whenever I visit.\"\n","This brought a laugh from Rohan, who then turned the tables.\n","\"Only if you promise to actually start playing again, because your dream doesn't need a huge investment or a business plan, it just needs you to open that case.\"\n","He looked at Sameer seriously.\n","\"Start small, man.\n","Don't think about a YouTube channel or gigs right now, just pick it up and play for yourself first, just to remember how it feels.\n","Maybe we can even try writing a song together in Rishikesh, something stupid and fun about our Matheran trip, just to get the creative engine started again.\"\n","The suggestion hung in the air, feeling both exciting and incredibly daunting to Sameer.\n","The fear of not being good enough anymore was a heavy cloak he had worn for years, a convenient excuse to never even try.\n","\"What if I've forgotten everything, what if it sounds terrible?\" he voiced his insecurity aloud.\n","Rohan simply shrugged.\n","\"Then it sounds terrible.\n","So what?\n","Who are you trying to impress?\n","This is for you, Sameer.\n","It's about reclaiming a part of yourself that you lost along the way.\"\n","He paused, his expression turning more serious.\n","\"We are so afraid of failing at our passions that we prefer the guaranteed, slow failure of a life we don't love.\n","We fear the judgment of others for trying something new, yet we don't seem to mind the silent, internal judgment we pass on ourselves every single day for not trying at all.\"\n","Just as the weight of that thought settled, Rohan's pocket buzzed.\n","He pulled out his phone, the screen lighting up his face with a cold, blue light, showing a notification from his work chat group.\n","It was from Kyra.\n","The message read: \"Team, gentle reminder - please ensure the Q3 projection sheets are updated EOD tomorrow.\n","Let's proactively synergize to avoid any last-minute firefighting.\n","Thanks.\"\n","The corporate jargon, the fake politeness, the sheer audacity of a message well past 1 AM – it was a perfect summary of everything they were trying to escape.\n","Rohan let out a hollow laugh and showed the screen to Sameer.\n","\"Speaking of silent judgment, here's a loud one.\n","EOD tomorrow.\n","Proactively synergize.\n","She uses these words like she's trying to cast a spell, a dark corporate spell that sucks your will to live.\"\n","He shook his head, the brief flicker of hope from their conversation momentarily extinguished by this digital leash.\n","\"Last week, we had a three-hour-long video call where she spent the first forty-five minutes talking about 'optimizing our deliverables' and 'leveraging our core competencies', and I swear, by the end of it, no one in the team, including her, had any idea what the actual point of the meeting was.\n","It's a performance, a grand play where everyone uses complicated words to hide the simple, terrifying fact that most of what we do is utterly pointless.\"\n","That single message acted as a catalyst, crystallizing their vague frustrations into a sharp, clear resolve.\n","It was the \"before\" picture to the \"after\" they were desperately trying to build for themselves.\n","Watching the frustration on Rohan's face, Sameer felt a surge of protective friendship and a shared sense of rebellion.\n","\"This is exactly why you need to build that cafe, and exactly why I need to pick up that guitar,\" he said, his voice firm.\n","\"Because if we don't, this will be our reality forever.\n","We'll become people who use words like 'proactively synergize' without even flinching.\n","We'll become the Kyras of the world.\"\n","The horror of that thought was more potent than any fear of failure.\n","They had reached the main road now, the point where their paths home diverged.\n","The streetlights seemed brighter here, the world a little more real.\n","They stood facing each other, the energy from their hours-long conversation culminating in this final, unspoken agreement.\n","This wasn't just a late-night chat anymore; it was a pact.\n","\"So, Rishikesh, bookings by this weekend, no excuses,\" Rohan said, breaking the silence.\n","\"Done,\" Sameer replied, extending a fist.\n","Rohan bumped it.\n","\"And you, send me a recording of the first chord you play, no matter how bad it sounds.\"\n","\"Only if you send me the first draft of your cafe's menu, no matter how weird the combinations are,\" Sameer countered with a grin.\n","\"Deal.\"\n","With that, they finally parted ways, a simple \"Chal, good night\" carrying the weight of their entire conversation.\n","As Rohan walked the last stretch to his apartment building alone, the city's silence felt different now.\n","It was no longer empty; it was filled with possibilities.\n","He looked up at the moon, a faint sliver in the hazy, polluted sky, and for the first time in a very long time, he didn't feel like a corporate zombie walking home.\n","He felt like a man with a plan, a man who had just rediscovered his own blueprint.\n","The fear was still there, lurking in the shadows, but tonight, for the first time, hope was shining a little brighter.\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import
